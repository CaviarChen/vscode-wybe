# Wybe Language Support
[![vsmarketplacebadge](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/wybe.vscode-wybe.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wybe.vscode-wybe)

Support for the [Wybe programming language](https://github.com/pschachte/wybe/) in Visual Studio Code.

This is an experimental version and it is a manually written textmate grammar based on regex.
So it doesn't parse Wybe documents properly and there is no guarantee that it shares the same behavior with the compiler.

This should be good enough for now as Wybe is still at an early stage of development.
We are likely to move to language server protocol in the future.
